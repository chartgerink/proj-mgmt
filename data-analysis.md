# Data analysis

After data collection, data can be analyzed. First of all, raw data should be cleaned (e.g. missing values) and transformed (e.g. computing sum scores) so that they can be used directly by the preferred analysis program.
If analysis methods are not chosen before data collection, techniques should be specified and the appropiate software should be selected.

After the data is ready to use, and methods and software are selected, we can begin writing the analysis script. This could contain descriptives, assumption checks, and the analysis itself.

Lastly, results should be interpreted and written down.
