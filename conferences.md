# Visiting Conferences and Presenting the Project 

After you have published your article, and took a well deserved break, it is common to present your results at conferences and symposia. Before you can present you would have to register (in time), submit an abstract, take care of finances, book a fligt/train and hotel, and prepare a powerpoint of course.
