# Take a break

After finishing a task, especially if it's a project, you need to take a break. 

There are many different ways people relax. Take the time to find out what works for you. 

Make _sure_ that you don't shorten your well-deserved break due to (new) projects popping up - if it helps, explicitly block some relaxation time.
