# Data storage and management

This task requires some amount of work before data collection, although we tend to work on it during data collection instead. This task could involve the following:
1. Writing a data management plan (DMP)
2. Knowing where you're going to store your data as it comes in, keeping in mind the security and privacy requirements
3. Decide on your method for version control and communicate to colleagues/supervisors
4. Plan your data monitoring and back-ups
