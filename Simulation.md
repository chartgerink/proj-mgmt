# Overview of the steps
Write the code -> Test the code -> Set the desired parameters -> Run the simulation
# Write the code
Write the code with your brain and heart. Do use Github to control the versions, since you are using it now.
# Test the code
Code testing is always painful, but the Aha moments alwasy pay off. Just like your life.
# Set the desrired parameters
Two ways to confirm the parameter settings you should use. (1) Following what others do in the previous literature 
and (2) Following what your supervisors suggest. You should know that only (2) could help you to get rid of your supervisors' angry faces.
# Run the simulation
All about running simulation is wait, wait, and wait. Why not go for a walk on the mountain tops?
