# Ideas
All the wonderful post-it notes about IDEAS!
## Getting ideas
Options include either 'Brainstorming'or 'getting' the ideas. 
Getting ideas seems easier, but where do we get these from?
### Think about the problem
Think about the problem you've identified and try to understand the broader environment.
What kinds of factors will influence the problem?
From this get an overview of the potential project scope, and narrow this further to set the general goal of the research.
You are now at the start of a veeeeeeery long road! 
Take a deep breath and good luck!
